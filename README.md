# gametheory2019
Repository for the game theory mini-project (E1254 - Spring 2019).

Title: **Utility functions with compounding returns lead to evolution of co-operation in MAB networks**

flup.py is the main file containing the code for the simulation. 

Usage: python flup.py -n <Grid size> -u <Utility Function> -t <number of tasks> -c <compCap> -i <insight> -l <leakage> -o <output_file>

The output is stored in a text file specified by the parameter output_file in the same directory as flup.py

The utility function numbers and definitions are as given in the project report.
leakage is the export/sharing efficiency as mentioned in the report.
